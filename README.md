## About Me

Hello, I'm Fritz Ortiz, a full-stack software developer with a specialization in Automation. I enjoy building projects that challenge my skills and exploring new technologies. This is my GitHub profile, where I share my personal and open-source projects.

## Projects

Here are some examples of projects I have worked on:

1. Unit Status Report Automation
   - Description: This Python-based Program gathers information about my company's deployed hardware and creates timeline graphs that are then sent through email to set recepients
   - GitHub Repository: The repo is currently private due to the program working on the company's information, but you can read a general overview of the program [HERE](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:e64b0357-4705-43b5-bbcf-3646a410c877)
   - Technologies used: [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [SMTP](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)

2. DND character creator
   - Description: This project in a CLI interactive Dungeons and Dragons character creator where you can create a basic character to help indecisive players get a better idea of what to play by giving more simple choices.
   - GitHub Repository: [DND Charater Creator](https://github.com/Fritz-Ortiz/DND_Character_Creator/tree/main)
   - Technologies used: This program uses the requests module to make API calls that it then processes to give the user the information requested.

3. Dealership Review Site
   - Description: This project was the Captone Project for my certification in full stack development from IBM, It sets up a website where you can make accounts, control what cars dealerships have, check each dealership's identity and reviews by building a database an making CRUD calls through the API and a home page that shows the overview for all the dealerships. You can see pictures of it working by looking at the repo.
   - GitHub Repository: [Capstone Project](https://github.com/Fritz-Ortiz/agfzb-CloudAppDevelopment_Capstone)
   - Technologies used: I used IBM's cloud services to hold the data for the dealerships and their reviews as well as using their Emotion detection service to determine if a review was positive, neutral, or negative.

Feel free to explore my repositories for more projects and code samples.
